<p>La entidad catalana le dio el salario más alto de la plantilla, cerca de 4,5 millones de euros brutos en un contrato por seis temporadas,Following a 12th place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix, Ocon recorded twelve consecutive points finishes, but was often involved in incidents with teammate Pérez. At the Canadian Grand Prix, Pérez ignored requests from the team to let Ocon past in order to challenge Daniel Ricciardo for third place, and Pérez and Ocon eventually finished fifth and sixth respectively. The two drivers collided at the following Azerbaijan Grand Prix, forcing Pérez into retirement and giving Ocon a puncture. Ocon eventually recovered to finish sixth. They made contact again at the Belgian Grand Prix, where Ocon was squeezed towards a wall leading up to the Eau Rouge complex. The collision ended Pérez's race and Ocon went on to finish ninth. Ocon later remarked that he was "furious" with Pérez and that he "risked [their] lives". Force India team owner Vijay Mallya stated that the repeated incidents were "very concerning" and that he would enforce team orders thereon.</p>
